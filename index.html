                <h2>Aims of the group</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>To ensure everyone in our local community has the contact details of a neighbour who can help with picking up shopping, collecting prescriptions and other small tasks, or to put them in touch with someone who can help.</li>
                    <li>To keep in touch with the neighbourhood so that support offers/requests can be shared and acted upon as necessary, and to keep everyone in good spirits!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class='jumbotron'>
                <h2>Using the group</h2>

                <p><strong>Always remember</strong> - this is a large group and nobody here is police checked or verified in any way. We are just an informal group of neighbours helping each other out!</p>

                <p>Please only use this group to share important information, request assistance or update the group on your support activities</p>

                <p>If you are making arrangements or want to discuss an issue with another group member please message them privately. Try to keep general chat to a minimum so important requests do not get missed. Never share your own or others private address or personal details with the main group.</p>

                <p>If you have any concerns or questions please message asking for admin to contact you and we will message you privately. ***Please note this an informal voluntary group; do not expect immediate response!***</p>
